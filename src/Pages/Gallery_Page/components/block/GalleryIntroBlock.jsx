        Always been the artsy one in a crowd, I chose design not as a mere
        profession, but was driven solely by a deep-seated love for creating. My
        favorite pastime involves handcrafting journals to fill it up with my
        experiences and meaningful nothings in the form of watercolor paintings
        and sketches.
